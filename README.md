## Person

Create a method in the Person class which returns how another person's age compares. Given the instances p1, p2 and p3, which will be initialised with the attributes
name and age, return a sentence in the following format:
{other person name} is {older than / younger than / the same age as} me.

```javascript
const p1 = new Person("Samuel", 24)
const p2 = new Person("Joel", 36)
const p3 = new Person("Lily", 24)
p1.compareAge(p2) ➞ "Joel is older than me."
p2.compareAge(p1) ➞ "Samuel is younger than me."
p1.compareAge(p3) ➞ "Lily is the same age as me."
```

## Person Constructor

- Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
- All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
- Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")` :
- When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach` .
- The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`
- Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`
- When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
- Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`
- It should return a string with `name` and `age` . Example: `"Mary, 50"`

## Car Constructor

- Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.
- All instances built with Car:
  - should initialize with an `tank` at 0
  - should initialize with an `odometer` at 0
- Give cars the ability to get fueled with a `.fill(gallons)` method. Add the gallons to `tank` . - STRETCH: Give cars ability to `.drive(distance)` . The
  distance driven:
- Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
- Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
- STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
- The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer` .

## Baby Constructor

- Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
- Besides `name` and `age` , Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`
- Besides the methods on Person.prototype, babies have the ability to `.play()`
- Should return a string "Playing with x", x being the favorite toy.

## Playlist

- Add: Pushes the passed-through song to the songs array
- Play: Plays current song based on array index
- Stop: Holds place in array, but calls above stop song prototype function
- Next: Sets the next song in the songs array, calling the above play prototype function
- Song should take in two arguments, title and artist, which should both be added as properties when the Song constructor function is used.
- Play: Sets the song as playing using isPlaying
- Stop: Sets the song as not playing (isPlaying = false)

```javascript
const playlist = new Playlist();
const heyJude = new Song('Hey Jude', 'The Beatles');
const jaded = new Song('Jaded', 'Aerosmith');
playlist.add(heyJude);
playlist.add(jaded);
playlist.play(); // Hey Jude started to play
playlist.next(); // Hey Jude stopped, Jaded started
playlist.next(); // Jaded stopped, Hey Jude started
playlist.stop(); // Hey Jude stopped
playlist.play(); // Hey Jude started
```
